# id-card-generator
This is a console applicarion created in Java to generate ID card using HTML template. I have created this simple application for my friend. 

It is easy to change because I have used an heml file as template. So we can edit html in an html editor, make sure that output is intact, then generate png images from the html template. I have used an excel file for storing data.
